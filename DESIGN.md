# Project Design Document

## Introduction

This API will allow for an easy line of communication between a touring artist and their fanbase about details of the shows on an upcoming/partially completed tour.

## Background/Context

When an performing artist decides to go on a tour, it can be hard to keep track of show dates/locations/times.  This is especially the case if they are a smaller group dealing with smaller venues, which are often liable to change/cancel.  New and longtime fans alike are often left scrambling at the last minute, scouring all of (if any) of bands and venues social media looking for last-minute changes.
