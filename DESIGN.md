# Project Design Document

## Introduction

This API will allow for an easy line of communication between a touring artist and their fanbase about details of the shows on an upcoming/partially completed tour.

## Background/Context

When an performing artist decides to go on a tour, it can be hard to keep track of show dates/locations/times.  This is especially the case if they are a smaller group dealing with smaller venues, which are often liable to change/cancel.  New and longtime fans alike are often left scrambling at the last minute, scouring all of (if any) of bands and venues social media looking for last-minute changes.

## Stakeholders

 - **Artists**: people who need events, will be able to schedule, organize tours, social gatherings and events. They are interested in attendance tracking, and overall event planning.

 - **Fans**: they are interested in tracking the cities where the events of their favourite artists will be held. They rely on API to get the newest information about their artists and their tours and events.
